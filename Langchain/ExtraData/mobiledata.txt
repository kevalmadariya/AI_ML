Several key algorithms are crucial for mobile operating systems due to the unique constraints of mobile devicesâ€”like limited battery life, constrained memory, and reliance on touch and sensor inputsâ€”that are not primary concerns for traditional computer operating systems.1
Here are some algorithms and algorithmic strategies used in mobile OSes but generally not in computer OSes:

3. Sensor Fusion Algorithms ðŸ§­
Smartphones are packed with sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.8 Data from a single sensor is often noisy and inaccurate.
The Algorithm: Sensor Fusion algorithms, most commonly the Kalman Filter or a simpler Complementary Filter, are used at the OS level. These algorithms intelligently combine the data streams from multiple sensors to produce a single, far more accurate and stable estimate of the device's orientation and motion.9 For example, it can combine the gyroscope's fast but drifty rotation data with the accelerometer's slow but stable gravity vector to get a precise, drift-free orientation. This is essential for features like screen auto-rotation, step counting, and augmented reality, and is not a feature of standard computer OSes.

4. Radio Resource Control (RRC) State Management ðŸ“¶
Managing a cellular radio is a delicate balance between data speed and battery consumption. Keeping the radio in a high-power, active state provides instant connectivity but drains the battery quickly.
The Algorithm: Mobile OSes use complex state machine algorithms to manage the radio's power states.10 The radio can transition between a high-power "connected" state and various low-power "idle" or "dormant" states.11 The algorithm tries to predict when the user will need data and moves the radio to a lower-power state if no activity is detected for a few seconds. This process, sometimes called Fast Dormancy, is invisible to the user but is a critical algorithm for preserving battery life on any cellular-connected device.12 This concept has no equivalent in a typical Wi-Fi-only desktop or laptop.
